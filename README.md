# Deploy_Machine_Learning_Projects
This repository contains the examples of deploying AI, ML models using Python, Django and other techniques.

1. Deploying a Flask application for a Data Science Project - https://github.com/anshupandey/Deploy_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/Flask-IRIS-Classifier_predictor
Here an ML model is developed for the popular IRIS dataset, model is exported as a pickel file, the pickle file is loaded in Flask code and exposed as an API.

2. Deploying a tensorflow deep learning model using Flask - https://github.com/anshupandey/Deploy_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/mnist_flask_project


3. Deploying a chatterbot chatbot code using Flask - https://github.com/anshupandey/Deploy_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/Flask-chatterbot-app

4. Deploying an opencv model using Flask - https://github.com/anshupandey/Deploy_Machine_Learning_Projects/tree/master/mnist_flask_project
